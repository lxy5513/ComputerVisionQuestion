# ComputerVisionQuestion
一些浅显、深刻的计算机视觉领域的问题以及答案（希望能帮助其职业发展)

- What is the difference between exact matching, search and classification?

- What is the difference between global and local descriptors? ( [Computer Vision: What is the difference between local descriptors and global descriptors?](https://www.quora.com/Computer-Vision-What-is-the-difference-between-local-descriptors-and-global-descriptors) )

- What properties make an image / object easy to recognize?

- What are the advantages and drawbacks of deep learned features?
( [What are the key advantages and key disadvantages of artificial neural nets over other machine learning algorithms?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-key-advantages-and-key-disadvantages-of-artificial-neural-nets-over-other-machine-learning-algorithms) )

- What are the advantages and drawbacks of binary descriptors?

## Harder ones IMO, more open:

- What do you think is the minimum size of an image signature database that could be used to recognize the covers of all CDs sold on Amazon?

- When is sight not the best sense to use to make sense of a situation?

- Is search by music closer to text search or search by image? Why?

## More practical ones:

- Do you know Brewer's concepts of "harvest" and "yield"? How do they apply to image search?

- How do you quantize features in large dimensions? Why do you have to?

- What ANN algorithms do you know? (Note: here I meant Approximate Nearest Neighbor, not Artificial Neural Network! But both probably work.)

- How do you tune a KD-forest?

\* Can you build an image search engine on top of something like Elastic Search? Advantages / drawbacks?
